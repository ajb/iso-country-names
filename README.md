iso-country-names
====

Takes the list formerly available [here](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_names_and_code_elements_txt) (need to find the new URL) and turns it into a js object.

> Looks like ISO is trying to paywall this info. http://www.spoonfork.org/isocodes.html is a decent source for now?
